                In the trailer, we can see some political figures debating and talking about the truth and the world, nothing is very clear,
                 and the theme that "the truth lies" returns in this preview. Then, the video cuts to the soldier on the game's cover and the video ends.
                We still don't know much about the plot and gameplay of COD Black Ops 6, but news should be presented during the Xbox Showcase on <span class="emphasis"> June 9th</span>.
